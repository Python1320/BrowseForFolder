Browse for folder hook
=============

Adds path dialog into the folder selection dialog. I'm losing my mind with this one.

Load with AppInit_DLLs. Example in setup.reg
For single apps you can use any injector. Winject is a good one: http://www.cheat-project.com/cheats-hacks/1382/WinJect-1.7/

Tested on Windows Server 2012 R2 (Windows 8.1)
